# University Admin System

## About
This project contains a simplified University Admin System written in Java. This project aimed to redesign the previous implementation using OOP principles, SOLID design principles, MVC model, etc. The changes made have been justified through a UML diagram and improved WMC, CBO, and DIT software metrics. 

## Running The Application
As this is a command line application, the repository needs to be downloaded and run locally. Therefore, the following steps will allow you to run the application:
1. Clone this repository using this command: `git clone https://github.com/PJhaveri02/Refactor-Program.git`
2. Change directory to the **Main** Java file: `cd ./src/com/softeng306`
3. Compile the application: `javac Main.java`
4. Run the application: `java Main`


## Conclusions
- This project allowed me to learn about how software development occurs in a team environment
- This project taught me the importance of writing descriptive and readable code to ease the development process
- The redesign of the application showed an improvement to the WMC, CBO, and DIT software metrics by up to 15%
